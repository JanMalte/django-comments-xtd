# JavaScript Tests - Scene 3

This scene represents the situation in which:
 * There is one comment posted,
 * a comment form is displayed,
 * a reply form underneath the comment is displayed too,
 * and the reactions.js module is enabled by establishing data-guest-user="0" and data-react-url="/comments/api/react/" in the "[data-dcx=config]" element.
 * Only the module **reactions.js** is tested.
